# Shotgun Sequencing MIQ (Measurement Integrety Quotient) Calculator

*Terra incognita,* or land unknown, was a term used by cartographers to describe lands that were known to exist but had not yet been explored well enough to map.  While this phrase disappeard from maps over the last few centuries, it is ever-present in science. Biases in microbiome analysis have been known to exist since nearly the time the field began, but for many experiments, they remain *terra incognita.* Exploring this area provides us with a critical next step in the evolution of microbiome research and the constant drive to improve our work.

     There is always one more thing to learn.
                                 â€“ Steve Jobs

At Zymo Research, our motto is, "*The beauty of science is to make things simple*," and it is with this principle guiding our efforts that we offer you this software package.
Like many great scientific tools, this package hides much of the complexity of its inner workings in order simplify a common analysis.  Under the hood of this system, you'll find [BWA](https://github.com/lh3/bwa "Github"), [Samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools), and the [NGS MIQ Score Calculator](https://github.com/Zymo-Research/miqScoreNGSReadCountPublic), the last of which was initially developed for this application.  The mission of this application is identical to the [ZymoBIOMICS](https://www.zymoresearch.com/pages/zymobiomics-portfolio) mission: increasing the reproducibility and standardization of microbiome analysis.  Due to the multiple dependencies and need for reproducibility of results and environment in this software package, we have packaged it entirely within a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image to ensure consistency between machines and runs.

#### Publication
Publication on this method is pending.  Watch this space for news and a link once it is available on bioRXiv.

## Quick Start Guide

This guide assumes you already have Docker installed and running on your system as well as the privileges to execute Docker commands.  To learn more about Docker, please check out [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com) for several excellent interactive tutorials on the use of Docker.

#### Downloading and building the image
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Zymo-Research/miqScoreShotgunPublic.git
cd miqScoreShotgunPublic
docker build -t miqscoreshotgun .
```

#### Running the analysis
The simplest method to run this analysis (in this writer's opinion, at least) is to have the data ready and waiting in a file structure already set up to mount to the container.  Using this practice will ensure that the container finds the expected input files and will output data to the expected location as well as providing an easy system to script against for automation, with iteration only requiring the movement of files.

To do this, create the following directory structure somewhere on your system where you have read and write permissions:

```
.
+-- input
|  +-- sequence
|     +-- standard_submitted_R1.fastq
|     +-- standard_submitted_R2.fastq
+-- working
+-- output
```
This directory can have any name desired (**dataMountDirectory** will be used from here on as its name) so long as it conforms to good naming practices.  The files standard_submitted_R1.fastq and standard_submitted_R2.fastq are where this docker will look for read 1 and read 2 data, respectively, if no other files are specified.  If running in SE or LONG mode, only standard_submitted_R1.fastq will be used.  These file names will work even if the fastq files are compressed using gzip.

To run this container, you need only supply the path to the above-described directory structure and a sample name:

```
docker container run -v [pathTo]/dataMountDirectory:/data -e SAMPLENAME=My_Sample_Name miqscoreshotgun
```

For more advanced usage, several parameters can be set using environment variables passed into the container at runtime. The environment variables that can be passed are as follows:

| Variable        | Type           | Default  | Description |
| --------------- |:--------------:|:--------:|-------------|
SAMPLENAME	|	string	|	**REQUIRED**	|	A name for the sample, should conform to good file-naming practices
MAXREADCOUNT	|	integer	|	0	|	Maximum reads to allow for analysis, will stop if a larger set of reads is provided. (Enter a value less than 1 for no limits)
FORWARDREADS	|	string	|	/data/input/sequence/standard_submitted_R1.fastq	|	Path to forward reads within the container (likely a mounted folder)
REVERSEREADS	|	string	|	/data/input/sequence/standard_submitted_R2.fastq	|	Path to forward reads within the container (likely a mounted folder)
SEQUENCEFOLDER	|	string	|	/data/input/sequence	|	Path to folder containing input sequences within the container
WORKINGFOLDER	|	string	|	/data/working	|	Path to working folder for temporary files
OUTPUTFOLDER	|	string	|	/data/output	|	Folder within the container to write output data
REFERENCEGENOME	|	string	|	[folderWithPackage]/reference/zrCommunityStandard.fa	|	File containing the reference sequence for the standard within the container
FILENAMINGSTANDARD	|	string	|	ZYMO	|	How sequence files will be named (other option is "illumina")
MODE | string | PE | Running mode.  PE for paired-end, SE for single end, LONG for Nanopore reads.  PE and SE use similar alignment but different analysis logic. SE and LONG use the same analysis logic, but different aligners.


## OUTPUT
All outputs will be written to the designated output folder for the container, which will unmount upon completion of the run.

There will be two primary output files, one report in HTML format and one in JSON format.  Examples of these can be seen [here for HTML](https://github.com/Zymo-Research/miqScoreShotgunPublic/blob/master/exampleReport.html) and [here for JSON](https://github.com/Zymo-Research/miqScoreShotgunPublic/blob/master/exampleReport.json).  The HTML report is designed to be viewed in a browser and gives an overview of the results for the sample.  The JSON report, while human-readable, is designed primarily to facilitate analysis using an automated script.  It also provides much more detailed information on the results than the HTML report.  
In addition to the two primary files, there will be a log file that can be used in the event of a problem with analysis for additional information on the run.  Finally, there will be several files generated by the DADA2 pipeline.  If you are familiar with DADA2, you will be familiar with these outputs.
